#use node upload file

	sometimes we need some recource on a public server that we can access by our public app. for example : advert image.
so we may upload resource repeatability. 
	as a developer, time is code! 
	so make this project for some people who want to upload resource and is incapable of linux cammand. 
we can build a web project for Operations team to upload for themselves.

	use node.js to upload a file to server.
